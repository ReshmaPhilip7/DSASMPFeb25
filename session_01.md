# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
###creating systems that mimic human intelligence.One system has to pass turing test to become equal to human intelligence but no system has passed it yet.
World is working to reach that goal.
## Artificial General Intelligence
## History of Artificial Intelligence
###Started with perceptron
### Perceptron
####It is equivalent to one neuron which has dendrites ,axons and neurons. It could solve AND and OR gate logic but not XOR gate.
### Backpropagation
####Uses many perceptrons to solve complex problems including XOR gate.
### AI Winter
### DARPA Grand Challenge 2005
####A car known as Standley from Standford University lead by Prof. Sebastian won the match. The match was to check which car moved from point A to B having obstacles without a driver.They used many sensors , not only GPS.
### ImageNet 2012
### 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics 
####Jeffrey Hinton won the prize for AI.
### Deepseek
####Created by China in Jan 2025
## Key Deciding Factors of Growth of AI
###Explosion of data and its generation with digital devices
###Advancements in computing power
###Algorithmic improvements
## Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
####AI - creating smart machines to mimic human behaviour
####ML-Subset of AI, builds model based on training data to make predictions
####Data science - subset of AI,area of statistics , scientific method to extract insights
## Data Science Application Domains
####Healthcare, E-commerce.Banking.Finance,Manufacturing
## Correlation Vs. Causation
####Correlation can be obtained from some studies but not causation.Correlation means that A is one factor which affects B but not the only factor(causation).
## Ethics in AI
####Privacy,Accountability,Safety,Transparency,Respect for human value,Fairness
